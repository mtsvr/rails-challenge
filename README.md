# Full-Stack Coding Challenge
### Ruby on Rails - Ruby


Project Requirements:

* Ruby version
2.7.2
* Node Version
14.15.4

#### The Challenge:

You are hired by the CheeZies pizza store to create their order placement application and have the responsibility to make it handle the business’ growing number of customers and orders. Thus, CheeZies wants their app to:

* Display the menu
* Create Orders
* List Orders
* Keep track of all operations

If possible, document any assumptions and design decisions you make.

#### Backend 
We will provide you with a project in Ruby on Rails 6. Some possible models are: Products or Items, which have a name and price—e.g. Margherita $5, Pepperoni $6—order, containing items, and order item, consisting of pizza and quantity.

Rspec is already added into the project so you can add specs to the basic backend functionality.

#### Frontend
For the front end you can use ERB, HAML or even React. 

We have already installed Bootstrap and feel free to use any other library that will help you make a quick UI. 

Testing the frontend using capybara is not mandatory.
